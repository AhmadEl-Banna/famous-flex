famous-flex
==========

Flexible, animated and plugable layout-controller for famo.us, which:

- Smoothly animates renderables between layouts (using physics)
- Makes it easy to layout renderables (without having to create lots of modifiers)
- Is shipped with various commonly used layouts
- Allows you to easily create custom layouts and layout-helpers
- Is very good at creating responsive designs

Above anything, famous-flex is a concept in which renderables are seperated from how
they are layed-out. This makes it possible to change layouts on the fly and animate
the renderables from one layout to another. For instance, you can layout a collection
of renderables using a `GridLayout`, and change that into a `ListLayout`. When using
`FlowLayoutController` the renderables will smoothly transition from the old state
to the new state using physics, particles and springs.

### Roadmap

Famous-flex is still in its infancy. I am commited in creating a first-class
layout-solution for famo.us that is as performant, pluggable and awesome as
can be. But to do this, I need your support and feedback. Let me know which of
features below are most important to you, by leaving a comment in the corresponding
issue.

- [Scrolling](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/famous-flex/issues/1) (Scrollview/container supporting layout-functions + smooth transitions)
- [Effects](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/famous-flex/issues/2) (Apply after-effects on the renderables)
- [AutoLayout](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/famous-flex/issues/3) (Cassowary constraints)
- [Drag & drop](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/famous-flex/issues/5) (Drag & drop renderables in a layout)

## Getting started

Install using bower or npm:

	bower install famous-flex

	npm install famous-flex

If necessary, add to the requirejs paths config:

```javascript
require.config({
    paths: {
        ...
        'famous-flex': 'node_modules/famous-flex/src',
        ...
    }
});
```

Example of laying out renderables using a CollectionLayout:

```javascript
var FlowLayoutController = require('famous-flex/FlowLayoutController');
var CollectionLayout = require('famous-flex/layouts/CollectionLayout');

// create collection-layout
var layoutController = new FlowLayoutController({
	layout: CollectionLayout,
	layoutOptions: {
		itemSize: [100, 100],
		gutter: [20, 20],
		justify: true
	},
	dataSource: [
		new Surface({content: 'surface1'}),
		new Surface({content: 'surface2'}),
		new Surface({content: 'surface3'})
	]
});
this.add(layoutController);
```


## LayoutController and FlowLayoutController

Layout-controllers are at the heart of famous-flex. They take a datasource
containing renderables, a layout function as input and render them to the famo.us
render-tree. Whenever the datasource is changed, the Layout-controller
updates the renderables according to the wishes of the layout function.

`LayoutController` is the most basic and lightweight version of a Layout-controller
and should be used when you don't need any smooth transitions.

`FlowLayoutController` uses physics to animate renderables from one state to
another. FlowLayoutController really demonstrates the power of famous-flex
in that it can flow renderables from any layout to another. Physics, particles
and springs are used to smoothly animate renderables in natural patterns.


For optimal performance, the layout-controller tries to minimize the
execution of the layout-function. The layout function is only executed when:
- A resize occurs
- `setLayout` is called on the layout-controller
- `setLayoutOptions` is called on the layout-controller
- `setDirection` is called on the layout-controller
- `reflowLayout` is called on the layout-controller
- `insert` or `remove` is called on `FlowLayoutController`

NOTE: If you make changes to a data-source, then you must explicitely
call `reflowLayout` to ensure that the layout is updated.


## Standard layouts

Famous-flex is shipped with a selection of commonly used layouts. It is also very easy
to [write your own layout functions](#layout-function).

|Layout|Description|
|---|---|
|[GridLayout](docs/layouts/GridLayout.md)|Grid-layout with fixed number of rows & columns.|
|[ListLayout](docs/layouts/ListLayout.md)|Lays out renderables in a horizontal or vertical list.|
|[CollectionLayout](docs/layouts/CollectionLayout.md)|Lays out renderables with a specific width & height.|
|[HeaderFooterLayout](docs/layouts/HeaderFooterLayout.md)|Layout containing a top-header, bottom- footer and content.|
|[NavBarLayout](docs/layouts/NavBarLayout.md)|Layout containing one or more left and right items and a title.|


## Datasource

The data-source contains the renderables that are to be layed-out.
It can be one of three things:

- An `Array`
- A `ViewSequence`
- An `Object` with key/value pairs

Example of an array/sequence of renderables:

```javascript
var layoutController = new LayoutController({
	layout: GridLayout,
	layoutOptions: {
		cells: [3, 1],
	},
	dataSource: [
		new Surface({content: 'surface1'}),
		new Surface({content: 'surface2'}),
		new Surface({content: 'surface3'})
	]
});
```

Example of an object with key/value pairs:

```javascript
var layoutController = new LayoutController({
	layout: NavBarLayout,
	dataSource: {
		'title': new Surface({content: 'title'}),
		'leftItems': [
			new Surface({content: 'btn1'}),
			new Surface({content: 'btn2'})
		]
	}
});
```


## Layout function

A layout is either represented as a [layout-literals](#layout literals) or a `Function` with the following parameters:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {LayoutContext} context Context used for enumerating renderables and setting the layout
 * @param {Object} [options] additional options that were passed to the function
 */
function LayoutFunction(context, options) {
	// put your layout-logic here
};
```

It is easy to create your own layout functions. In order to do this read the [LayoutContext documentation](docs/LayoutContext.md) which contains various examples.


## Layout helpers

Layout helpers are special classes that simplify writing layout functions.

|Helper|Literal|Description|
|---|---|---|
|[LayoutDockHelper](docs/helpers/LayoutDockHelper.md)|`dock`|Layout renderables using docking semantics.|


## Layout literals

Layout literals are objects which describe layouts through a definition rather
than a function. The following example describes the use of a layout literal 
using `dock` semantics:

```javascript
var layoutController = new LayoutController({
	layout: {dock: [
		['top', 'header', 50],
		['bottom', 'footer', 50],
		['fill', 'content']
	]},
	dataSource: {
		header: new Surface({content: 'Header'}),
		footer: new Surface({content: 'Footer'}),
		content: new Surface({content: 'Content'})
	}
});
```

Layout literals are implemented through LayoutHelpers. To create your own
layout literals, perform the following steps:
- Create a LayoutHelper (see [LayoutDockHelper](src/helpers/LayoutDockHelper.js) for an example).
- Implement the `parse` function on the LayoutHelper.
- Register the helper using `LayoutUtility.registerHelper`.
